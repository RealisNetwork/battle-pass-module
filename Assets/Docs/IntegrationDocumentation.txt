1) Client must implement interfaces:
        - IBattlePassValidationService (This is where the player's balance is checked to perform an action.)
        - IBattlePassNetworkRequestsLayer (This is how messages are sent to the server.)
        - IBattlePassCallbacks (Here the processing of events that occurred during the operation of the module is implemented.)

        - IRewardStrategy (It is necessary to implement the processing of accrual of each type of awards)
2) All responses from the server must be forwarded to the "IBattlePassResponseListener"
3) The "IBattlePassService" interface is used to work with the module.
4) ZenjectInstallerExtension extension for quick bind using a Zenject plugin. You will also need to additionally bind all interfaces implemented by the client.
